Redis Customer Support:
If Redis is solely being utilized for basic cache handling, you would not likely need to purchase a license for an enterprise version of Redis. 

However, as I cannot provide you with legal advice, I urge you to consult with your own legal representative. Additionally, our licensing site at https://redis.io/legal/licenses/

Redis Licensing Overview - Redis
Learn about the Redis Source Available License 2.0 (RSALv2), SSPL, and the open source 3-Clause-BSD license.
redis.io
 provides a good summary of the updates to our licensing model and the restrictions under our updated licenses. 

Finally, please note that our shift to the dual licensing model only impacts versions of Redis from 7.4 forward - versions released prior to version 7.4 are not impacted and their licensing structure is unchanged.
